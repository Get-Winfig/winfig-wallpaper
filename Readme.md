![Winfig Banner](.github/images/Banner.png)

This repository contains a collection of high-quality wallpapers specifically designed and collected from different sources to enhance the visual appeal of your Windows Environment. Whether you're looking for stunning landscapes, abstract designs, or minimalist themes, you'll find a variety of options to suit your taste.

Images live in the `images` directory and use short numeric filenames (for example `001-3904x2240.png`, `002-4032x2688.jpg`, etc) to make it easy to reference them in documentation and issues.

## Usage
To use these wallpapers:

1. **Browse** the `images` directory to find wallpapers you like
2. **Download** the desired image(s) by clicking on them and selecting "Download"
3. **Set as wallpaper**:
   - Right-click on your desktop → "Personalize" → "Background"
   - Or go to Settings → Personalization → Background
   - Select "Picture" and browse to your downloaded image

## Copyright and Attribution

**Important:** We respect intellectual property rights.

If you are the original creator of any wallpaper in this collection and would like it to be:
- **Removed**: Please open an issue with the filename and proof of ownership
- **Properly attributed**: Please provide the attribution details you'd like displayed

Our goal is to respect the rights of original creators while providing a valuable resource for Windows users.
